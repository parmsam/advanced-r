# General

## Recommendations
- Default to S3 b/c it's simple and widely used in Base R and CRAN.
- If you have a prior background in programming, resist the temptation to use R6 b/c it's easy to create a non-idiomatic API with alot of pain points. Also, you'll lose out on a new way of thinking about OOP.

## S3 vs R6
- See [Ch16](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/oo-tradeoffs.html).
