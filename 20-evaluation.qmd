# General

## Evaluation intro

- `eval()` evaluates an expression in an environment
- a quosure is a data structure that captures an expression along with its associated environment, as found in function arguments
- a data mask makes it easier to evaluate an expression in the context of a data frame
- quasiquotation, quosures, and data masks form what we call **tidy evaluation**

## How eval() works

- `eval()` has two arguments `expr` and `envir`:
  - the object to evaluate, typically a symbol or expression
    - this first argument is evaluated, not quoted
  - and the environment in which the expression should be evaluated
    - by default, this is the current environment, i.e. the calling environment
