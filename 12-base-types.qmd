# General

-   As John Chambers said, Everything that exists in R is an object.

-   To tell the difference between a base and OO object, use [`is.object()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/is.object.html) or [`sloop::otype()`](https://sloop.r-lib.org/reference/otype.html). The difference between base and OO objects is that OO objects have a \"class\" attribute. Every object has a base type.

-   There are 25 different base types. They are added very rarely.
